Note Frequency to BPM Calculator and Key Player

This application allows you to calculate the frequencies of musical notes based on a base frequency input, using the Pythagorean tuning system. 
The Pythagorean tuning system is an ancient method of tuning that is based on pure perfect fifths (3:2 ratio) and other simple ratios derived from it. 
This system emphasizes harmonic relationships that are pleasing to the ear.

Key Features:
- Calculate note frequencies from a base frequency using Pythagorean ratios.
- Convert note frequencies to beats per minute (BPM) for different subdivisions.
- Real-time updates and user-friendly controls for adjusting frequencies.
- Play calculated note frequencies.
- Save and load configurations for recurring use.

This tool is ideal for musicians, music producers, educators, and hobbyists to explore and understand the relationships between frequencies, notes, and rhythms.
